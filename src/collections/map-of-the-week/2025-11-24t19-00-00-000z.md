review: '"Full spread with each level maintaining creativity. Great selection of rhythms with a mix of vocals and percussion, which highlights the featured part of each section within the song. The lighting in the Hip Hop environment is well done and Undeceiver has made full use of every feature of a Beat Saber map, right up until the very last bomb."'
