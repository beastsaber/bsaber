review: '"It’s easily one of the most creative maps of the year. The chorus features incredible patterns that capture the song perfectly, and the setup and execution of the horizontal section are masterfully done. The way the lighting and note angles change depending on who’s singing is pure genius. And with a full spread, everyone can enjoy."'
