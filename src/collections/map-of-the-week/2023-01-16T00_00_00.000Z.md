review: "The flawless representation, engaging dancey patterns with nice use of arcs and of walls for movement, and incredible light show in the Weeknd environment make this map shine! With its accessible full spread that beautifully carries the same feeling through the lower diffs plus four fun single saber guest diffs by Aalto, this map has something for everyone!"
